This mod includes:
- The Terra Former (I got the name from other mods)
- A fully balanced crafting tree (actually idk if it's balanced)
- A secret weapon only obtainable through cheat sheet, use it if you dare...

Updates:
Version 1.0.1:
- Enabled UseTurn for all pickaxes, so you can turn while using them.
- Buffed the Terra Former's pickaxe power from 250% to 500%.
- Added axe power to the Terra Former, so it now has 500% axe power.
